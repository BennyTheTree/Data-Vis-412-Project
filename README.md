## Project Description
This project provides an interactive data dashboard that visualizes stock market data from Yahoo Finance. Users can select a ticker (e.g., TSLA, AAPL, MSFT), choose a metric (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume), and filter by a date range to explore trends over time. The dashboard also features a color-coded volume chart (green/red) indicating up/down days and a mock buy/sell table.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourTeamRepo/StockMarketDashboard.git
